# Banking
Hello

This will contain all the ".java" files required in our project & it will contain the original files the teacher gave us
When you want to bring changes to one of the files, click on "branch" and give a name to a new branch that will contain your changes. Dont upload directly to the master!
ex: "banking-fix"
You can explain your changes when you commit

Honestly idk what I'm doing, heres a helpful link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
