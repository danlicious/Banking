Hey guys! To facilitate changes, upload ".java" (class) which are most likely inside of "..\NetBeansProjects\Banking\src\banking"

When editing files, click on "branch" and give a name (ex: "banking-fix") to the new branch. Don't upload directly to the master (unless you are sure that it won't interfere with anyone else's work)

If you want, add notes when you "commit" changes

Honestly idk what I'm doing, heres a helpful link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
